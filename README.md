This repository offers a collection of hands-on labs designed to simulate real-world production issues. Sharpen your skills in debugging, refactoring, pipeline optimization, and performance tuning with challenges that mirror what you'd encounter in a professional software engineering environment.

Each lab is a self-contained environment, providing:

*   **A Detailed README:** A comprehensive description of the challenge, the scenario, and your objectives.
*   **A Containerized Application/Pipeline:** A reproducible environment using Docker to ensure consistency.
*   **A Validation Script:** A tool to verify if your solution successfully resolves the issue.
*   **A Solutions Folder:** A community-driven collection of different approaches to solving the lab.

## üöÄ How to Engage

There are two primary ways to interact with this repository: as a **Solver** or as a **Contributor**.

### üîπ As a Solver

1. **Choose a Lab:** Browse the **Labs Index** section and pick a challenge that matches your interests or skill goals.
2. **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this page to create your own copy of the repository. This allows you to work independently and submit your changes.
3. **Set Up the Lab:** Clone your fork locally, navigate to the chosen lab's directory under `labs/<lab-name>/`, and follow the setup instructions in the lab's `README.md`. Use the provided scripts to start the environment and validate your work.
4. **Implement Your Fix:** Solve the challenge by making the necessary code changes, debugging, or optimizing as described in the lab instructions. Test your solution using the validation script provided.
5. **Submit Your Solution:** Add a JSON object describing your solution to the central `solutions/solutions.json` file. Include details such as your GitHub username, a brief summary of your approach, and a link to your solution write-up if available.
6. **Open a Pull Request:** Push your changes to your fork and open a Pull Request to the main repository. Your solution will be automatically validated, and upon approval, it will be added to our main [**Community Solutions**](SOLUTIONS.md) page.

For detailed, step-by-step instructions, please refer to our [**CONTRIBUTING.md**](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### üîπ As a Contributor

1. **Create a New Lab:** Copy the `labs/_template-lab/` directory to `labs/<your-lab-name>/` to start a new lab.
2. **Develop the Challenge:** Write a clear problem description, set up the containerized application or pipeline, and provide a validation script to check solutions.
3. **Add Metadata:** Complete the `lab.yaml` file with all relevant details about your lab, such as category, level, and grading metrics.
4. **Open a Pull Request:** Submit your new lab via a Pull Request. Our continuous integration pipeline will automatically validate your lab, and once merged, it will appear in the **Labs Index** for others to solve.

For more information on contributing new labs, see the [**CONTRIBUTING.md**](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide.
